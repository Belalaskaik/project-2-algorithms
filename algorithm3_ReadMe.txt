Project 2 Algorithm 3

Program Execution:

The program reads a text file named 'in2C.txt' that contains three arrays in the following format:

Array_1 = [list1, list2, list3, list4]
Array_2 = [list1, list2, list3, list4]
Array_3 = [list1, list2, list3, list4]
Each list contains integers separated by commas. 
The program converts the lists into three separate arrays and sorts them using the merge sort algorithm.

The program then prints the sorted arrays in the format:
Array_1 Output: [Sorted Elements from lists: 1-4]
Array_2 Output: [Sorted Elements from lists: 1-4]
Array_3 Output: [Sorted Elements from lists: 1-4]
