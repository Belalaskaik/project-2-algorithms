Project 2 Algorithm 2

How to Execute the Program:

1.Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.

2.Open a text editor and copy the code into a new file.

3.Save the file with a .py extension (e.g. run_encoding.py).

4.Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

5.Type "python run_encoding.py" and press Enter.

6.The program will execute and the output will be displayed in the command prompt or terminal window.

7.The program takes a string as input and applies run-length encoding to the string. 
It replaces all consecutive occurrences of a character with the number of occurrences followed by the character itself, 
except for characters that appear only once, which are not encoded.

8.To test the program, modify the input string in the code and run the program again.
